Treasure Map

You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:


line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input() # Where do you want to put the treasure?
# Your code below
letter = position[0].lower()
abc = ["a", "b", "c"]
letter_index = abc.index(letter)
number_index = int(position[1]) - 1
map[number_index][letter_index] = "X"

print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
